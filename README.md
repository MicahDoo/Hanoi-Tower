# Hanoi-Tower
Hanoi Tower

The HanoiTowerVisualized program written with C provides you with solutions to any Hanoi Tower puzzle with rings of number 3 to 15. (Of course, with a quick edit in the code you can jack that number up to infinity. But for program efficiency, we are gonna limit that to 15. Any tweak of the code should be done at your own discretion.)

I wrote this as a rookie coder of c (a rookie coder in general for that matter), so don't expect a pro-level, clean, pleasantly-styled program. I did this primarily to stretch my brain a bit as a beginner. Any suggestion is welcome.
